<h1>Biomedical Applications of Low Temperature Plasma
	</h1>

<p>Collaboration with Professor David Graves
	</p>

<h1>Exploring Antimicrobial Effects
	</h1>

<p>
Within the last fifteen years, low-temperature, atmospheric-pressure air plasma has 
been shown to have toxic effects against a variety of bacteria and other microorganisms. 
We study the application of air plasma as a means of surface and liquid disinfection. 
Currently, we are working to understand the relationship among plasma processing 
parameters, plasma chemistry, and microbial killing; we also aim to elucidate the 
biochemical and genetic effects of plasma treatment. An eventual goal of the project 
is to develop a low-cost, portable plasma sterilizer suitable for use in the 
developing world or emergency medicine.
	</p>

<h1>Investigating Cancer Applications
	</h1>
<p>  
Ambient plasma treatment has been shown to kill cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. 
We are investigating the mechanism of killing, focusing on detection of intracellular 
reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. We also aim to use mass spectrometry and gene 
expression microarrays to determine the effects on cellular processes. In addition, 
we are investigating the selectivity of plasma treatment for cancer cells over 
noncancerous cells, and investigating potential synergies between chemotherapy and 
plasma treatment. Our eventual goals are to quantify the effects of plasma treatment 
on mammalian cells and to develop a cancer therapy that can be used in conjunction 
with existing therapies.
