<h1>Structure and Function of Proteins from Extremophiles</h1>

<p>Complementary  to our research on extremophiles is our continuing 
	investigation of protein  structure-function relationships under the 
	expanded pressure and temperature  space afforded by stability of 
	these extremophilic proteins. We have previously found that many 
	thermophilic enzymes are substantially stabilized at high temperatures 
	by high  pressure. This effect appears to correlate with the internal 
	hydrophobicity and/or the structural rigidity of the protein. 
	High-pressure studies have thus  helped to elucidate the importance 
	of hydrophobic interactions and internal  flexibility in protein 
	stabilization. Significant activation by pressure has  also been 
	observed for some thermophilic proteins.
	</p>

<p>In recent years, our lab has focused on describing the protein folding 
	and degradative  machinery in extremophiles with the aim of exploiting 
	such stable proteins for  industrially important applications. To that 
	end, we have discovered a novel heat shock-inducible chaperone, 
	g prefoldin, which forms extended filaments. In related studies, 
	we have found that the  stability of chaperones in miscible organic 
	co-solvents correlates with melting  temperature in aqueous solution, 
	and have practically utilized this effect for  applications ranging 
	from antibiotic synthesis to biofuels production.
	</p>

<p>The emerging interface of biology and materials science is creating new 
	opportunities for the design, synthesis, and optimization of biologically-enabled 
	and biologically-inspired materials. For example, the incorporation of proteins 
	into polymers can result in hybrid materials that combine the properties of 
	the polymer as a cost-effective and easy to process material with the highly 
	evolved biological functionality of the protein, enabling new concepts for 
	construction of sensors and biomedical materials. We have recently proven 
	the concept of a protein-based nanosensor that is able to report deformation 
	of the embedding polymer matrix. We combined the structural properties of 
	a chaperonin from a thermophilic organism with the spectral properties of 
	fluorescent proteins in order to generate a protein complex that exhibits 
	fluorescent energy resonance transfer (FRET) and is sensitive to structural 
	deformation. Such self-reporting materials could be used in myriad applications 
	where easy and early detection of damage is essential to avoid catastrophic 
	failure of the material.
