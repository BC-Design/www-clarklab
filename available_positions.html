	<h1>Postdoctoral Researchers (2x)</h1>
	<h2>Clark Research Lab (Douglas S. Clark, PI)</h2>
	<h2>Energy Biosciences Institute and Dept. of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering</h2>

	<p>The Energy Biosciences Institute at the University of California, Berkeley seeks 
		applications for two Postdoctoral Researchers in the Clark Lab at 100%. The positions 
		are available immediately until suitable candidates are found.
		</p>

	<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Project I</span>
		The primary focus of this research project is to develop stabilized cellulases and/or
		cellulase systems for recycle and extended use in a continuous bioreactor. Techniques
		to consider include protein engineering, chemical modification, and/or enzyme immobilization.
		</p>

	<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Project II</span>
		This project aims to develop a continuous system for depolymerization of lignocellulosic
		biomass with recycle of enzymes through the reactor. Methods for the 
		<span style="font-style:italic>in situ</span> and/or offline analysis of products and/or
		biomass composition within the reactor will also be incoroporated, and the output of such
		measurements will be combined with process control algorithms for optimal operation
		of the system.
		</p>

	<p>For both projets, we seek applicants with a PhD in chemical engineering or a related field
		and experience in emzymology, protein enginering, and/or molecular modeling. Competitive 
		candidates are expected to have excellent oral and written communication skills and a 
		strong record of peer reviewed publications.
		</p>

	<p>Duties for both projects include:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Conduct research independently, and communicate ideas with supervisors and lab members
		</li>
	<li>Design and evaluate new experiments, develop new ideas, and expand on current research scope
		</li>
	<li>Be available to prepare manuscripts for publication of research findings
		</li>
	<li>Be available to attend and give seminars
		</li>
	<li>Use academic and work background to bring new expertise to the research program
		</li>
	<li>Train lab members and technicians on specialty lab equipment, and operate equipment throughout the lab
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>If interested, please email your cover letter and curriculum vitae (CV) to Christine Balolong at 
		<a href="mailto:cbalolong@berkeley.edu">cbalolong(AT)berkeley.edu</a>.
		</p>
	<p>The University of California is an Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action Employer; 
	the department is interested in candidates who will contribute to diversity and equal 
	opportunity in higher education through their work. UC Berkeley is committed to diversity 
	in all aspects of our mission and to addressing the family needs of postdoctoral researchers, 
	including dual career couples and single parents.

	<h1>Postdoctoral Researcher</h1>
	<h2>Clark Research Lab (Douglas S. Clark, PI)</h2>
	<h2>Dept. of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, UC Berkeley</h2>

	<p>The Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at the University of California, 
		Berkeley seeks applications for a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Clark Research Lab 
		at 100%. The position is available immediately until a suitable candidate is found.
		</p>
	<p>The focus of the project will be to employ thermostable protein building blocks to create 
	biomolecular assemblies ranging from motor-driven turbines to biomechanical devices. 
	Using his or her experience in protein engineering, expression, and purification, the 
	successful applicant will engineer and assemble recombinantly expressed and purified 
	protein components, such as filaments and connectors, into nanoscale mechanical 
	constructs. Another aim will be to engineer a microbial production host for programmable 
	biosynthesis, secretion, and assembly of these nanostructures.
		</p>
	<p>Highly motivated individuals with a PhD in bio/chemical engineering or related 
	field are encouraged to apply. Competitive candidates are expected to have 
	excellent oral and written communication skills, and a strong record of peer 
	reviewed publications.
		</p>
	<p>For further information, please contact Christine Balolong at 
		<a href="mailto:cbalolong@berkeley.edu">cbalolong(AT)berkeley.edu</a>
