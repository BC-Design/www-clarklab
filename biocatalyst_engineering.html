	<h1>Biocatalyst Engineering</h1>

	<p>A longstanding area of research in the Clark group has been the development of 
		biocatalysts for use in non-traditional media. Transferring or improving an enzyme&#8217;s 
		evolved catalytic properties for new media is an engineering challenge which can require 
		enzyme surface modification, solvent tailoring, or genetic manipulations.
		</p>

	<p>Many chemical transformations that are difficult or inefficient with traditional 
		catalysts are easily performed by enzymes. However, the utility of enzymes as 
		alternative catalysts is limited by their generally poor performance in conditions 
		other than aqueous buffer. In particular, conditions which are favorable for chemical 
		synthesis, such as  organic solvents, high temperatures or pressures, are wholly 
		unsuitable for enzymes, and here they perform orders of magnitude below their optima.
		</p>

	<p>The reduced catalytic activity in media such as organic solvents is due to changes 
		in enzyme properties that are critical to catalysis, including altered active site 
		electronics, the slowing of protein motions that are relevant to catalysis, or 
		structural loss. The Clark group has been successful in identifying these problems 
		and devising ways to mitigate them. Primary tools for protein structural and dynamic 
		characterization have been  NMR, ESR, and fluorescence spectroscopy, and we have 
		benefited greatly in this work from collaborations with Professors Jeff Reimer at 
		UC Berkeley and Jonathan Dordick at Rensselaer Polytechnic.
		</p>

	<p>Techniques for enhancing enzyme activity in organic solvents have been both simple 
		and complex. For example, lyophilization of enzyme powders with non-buffer salts has been 
		shown to increase enzyme active site polarity and protein flexibility. Properties of the 
		additive salt, such as its ability to order surrounding water, can dramatically influence 
		enzyme performance, increasing catalytic efficiencies up to 30,000-fold. Solubilization 
		of enzymes into organic solvents using surfactant pairing presents a solution-phase 
		version of a very active biocatalyst. Genetic engineering is another avenue for 
		increasing enzyme activity. Single point mutations have been shown to alter an 
		enzyme&#8217;s ability to accept a reaction cofactor. To help stabilize enzymes 
		against solvent or temperature induced unfolding, chaperone coding regions can be 
		attached to the enzymeâ€™s gene, resulting in a continuous enzyme-chaperone chimera 
		protein that is self-renaturing. All of these development are steps forward in the 
		eventual implementation of enzymes in the pharmaceutical, chemical, and agrochemical industries.
