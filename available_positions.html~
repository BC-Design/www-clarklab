	<h1>Postdoctoral Researcher</h1>
	<h2>Clark Research Lab (Douglas S. Clark, PI)</h2>
	<h2>Energy Biosciences Institute and Dept. of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering</h2>

	<p>The Energy Biosciences Institute at the University of California, Berkeley seeks 
		applications for a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Clark Lab at 100%. The position 
		is available immediately until a suitable candidate is found.
		</p>

	<p>The primary focus of this research project is to study the kinetics and mechanism(s) 
		of cellulase inhibition during biomass hydrolysis, and to employ molecular modeling 
		and protein engineering techniques to develop inhibition-resistant cellulases. We 
		seek applicants with a PhD in chemical engineering or a related field and experience 
		in enzymology, protein engineering, and/or molecular modeling. Competitive candidates 
		are expected to have excellent oral and written communication skills, and a strong 
		record of peer reviewed publications.
		</p>

	<p>Duties include:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Conduct research independently, and communicate ideas with supervisors and lab members
		</li>
	<li>Design and evaluate new experiments, develop new ideas, and expand on current research scope
		</li>
	<li>Be available to prepare manuscripts for publication of research findings
		</li>
	<li>Be available to attend and give seminars
		</li>
	<li>Use academic and work background to bring new expertise to the research program
		</li>
	<li>Train lab members and technicians on specialty lab equipment, and operate equipment throughout the lab
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>For further information, please contact Christine Balolong at
		<a href="mailto:cbalolong@berkeley.edu">cbalalong(AT)berkeley.edu</a>.
		</p>
	<p>The University of California is an Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action Employer; 
	the department is interested in candidates who will contribute to diversity and equal 
	opportunity in higher education through their work. UC Berkeley is committed to diversity 
	in all aspects of our mission and to addressing the family needs of postdoctoral researchers, 
	including dual career couples and single parents.

	<h1>Postdoctoral Researcher</h1>
	<h2>Clark Research Lab (Douglas S. Clark, PI)</h2>
	<h2>Dept. of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, UC Berkeley</h2>

	<p>The Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at the University of California, 
		Berkeley seeks applications for a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Clark Research Lab 
		at 100%. The position is available immediately until a suitable candidate is found.
		</p>
	<p>The focus of the project will be to employ thermostable protein building blocks to create 
	biomolecular assemblies ranging from motor-driven turbines to biomechanical devices. 
	Using his or her experience in protein engineering, expression, and purification, the 
	successful applicant will engineer and assemble recombinantly expressed and purified 
	protein components, such as filaments and connectors, into nanoscale mechanical 
	constructs. Another aim will be to engineer a microbial production host for programmable 
	biosynthesis, secretion, and assembly of these nanostructures.
		</p>
	<p>Highly motivated individuals with a PhD in bio/chemical engineering or related 
	field are encouraged to apply. Competitive candidates are expected to have 
	excellent oral and written communication skills, and a strong record of peer 
	reviewed publications.
