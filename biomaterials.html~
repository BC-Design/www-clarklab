<h1>Biomaterials and Biocatalytic Microsystems
	</h1>

<p>Drug  discovery is an arduous process taking nearly 13 years of research and nearly  $1b for 
	every successful drug that reaches the market. A major reason for this low success rate 
	and high cost is because of the factors that are not typically  considered in the early 
	stages of drug discovery, including poor ADME/tox (absorption, distribution, metabolism, 
	excretion, and toxicology) profiles. Thus, pharmaceutical companies are beginning to 
	evaluate toxicity of drug candidates early in the discovery process to reduce the chances 
	of late-stage failure.
	</p>

<p>We have addressed this issue with the development of a high-throughput miniaturized 3D 
	cell-culture array (the Data Analysis Toxicology Assay Chip or DataChip) and a P450 enzyme 
	array (the Metabolizing Enzyme Toxicology Assay Chip or MetaChip) for <em>in vitro</em> 
	high-throughput toxicity  screening of drug candidates and their cytochrome P450- generated 
	metabolites. These chips are capable of working with volumes as low as 20 nL, which is more 
	than 2000-fold reduction than what is currently used in the pharmaceutical industries.
	</p>

<p>The  MetaChip consists of P450 enzymes encapsulated in a polymeric sol-gel matrix, spotted in an 
	array format (<em>PNAS</em>, 2005, <u>102</u>:983-987), and the DataChip consists of human 
	cells encapsulated in a collagen or an alginate matrix, spotted in an array format complementary 
	to the MetaChip. Both MetaChip and DataChip use glass slides treated specially for the attachment 
	of the sol-gel or collagen/alginate  matrices. We recently demonstrated 
	(<em>PNAS</em>, 2008, <u>105</u>:59-63) that the DataChip containing 1,080 individual cell cultures, 
	used in conjunction with the complementary MetaChip, simultaneously provided toxicity profiles for 
	nine compounds and their metabolites from CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 and a mixture  of the three 
	P450s designed to emulate the human liver. The DataChip-MetaChip system has opened up opportunities 
	for rapid, inexpensive and convenient evaluation of <em>in vitro</em> toxicity. This system will 
	also enable chemical companies to comply with new legislation stipulating that chemicals undergo 
	toxicity analysis, especially European cosmetics companies will be restricted from animal testing 
	starting in 2009, making the need for new <em>in vitro</em> methods even more important. Our 
	discovery has created considerable  excitement in both the popular media 
	(<a href="http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=biochips-drug-animal-testing">1</a>,
	<a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/Biotech/19984/">2</a>) and in the scientific community 
	(<a href="http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2007/12/18_datachip.shtml">3</a>,
	<a href="http://news.rpi.edu/update.do?artcenterkey=2376">4</a>). 
	We are now adapting our high-throughput platform for <em>in situ</em> enzymatic modification 
	of drug candidates, and also understanding the mechanisms of drug action.
